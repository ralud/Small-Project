Small Project Description
=============

For the small project I will look at the relationship between NYC restaurant inspection grades (avialable publicly at NYC open data) and characteristics of the restaurant cuisines. 

In particular, I want to test the hypotheses that foreign food safety and hygene norms affect restaurant health grades in the United States. For that, I will explore whether NYC health inspection grades are correlated with a measure of the level of strictness of food safety standards and hygene norms in the countries where the restaurant cuisine is predominant. 

The data that I will use for this project is:
* NYC restaurant inspection data (available here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck)
* Cross-country data on food standards. I was not successful in finding this dataset yet, so I will probably end up using a country's income per capita to proxy its level of development and implicitly its food safety standards. This data is available here: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators
